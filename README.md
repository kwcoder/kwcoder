### Welcome to my corner of GitHub!
I am a soon-to-be **Carbon Analyst**, having recently completed my MSc in **Data Science** at the University of Birmingham. While there, I developed an interest in using **Natural Language Processing** to analyse and generate online content, aiming to improve the accuracy of [**knowledge distribution**](https://github.com/kwcoder/wikipedia-see-also-automation/blob/main/README.md) sources.

* 🌱 Improving my skills in _pandas_ and SQL.
* 💡 Interested in projects combining market research, behavioural insights, and strategy.
* 💞️ Seeking collaborations on data projects exploring digital behaviour, especially in-group/out-group dynamics.
* ⚡ Fun facts: Reading 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism' by Shoshana Zuboff.
  I enjoy mechanistic and inferential data science projects the most.
