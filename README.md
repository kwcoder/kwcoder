- 👀 I’m interested in: Unraveling human behavioral patterns through data. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Python, SQL, Tableau, Advanced Statistical Analysis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: projects that get me closer to gaining deeper insights into the interplay between group behaviour, biases, and ethical considerations.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favourite data science projects tend to fall into either mechanistic or inferential categories.
