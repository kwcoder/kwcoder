### Hi, I'm Kenya 👋🏾
* 😄 Pronouns: she/her 
* 👀 I’m an aspiring data scientist, having just completed my MSc in Data Science at the University of Birmingham.
* 💡 My ideal career would involve a combination of market research, behavioural insights, and strategic proposal development.
* 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in: Python (pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch), SQL, Tableau, and advanced statistical analysis.
* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: projects that use data to unravel human behavioural patterns. I would especially like to gain deeper insights into in-group out-group dynamics in online spaces.
* ⚡ Fun facts: I am currently reading 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism' by Shoshana Zuboff to qualify my interest in Computational Social Science. 
  My favourite data science projects tend to fall into either mechanistic or inferential categories.
