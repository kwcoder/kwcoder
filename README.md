#### About Me 
* 👀 I’m an aspiring data scientist, having just completed my MSc in Data Science at the University of Birmingham.
* 🌱 I’m currently improving my skills in _pandas_ and SQL.
* 💡 My ideal project would involve a combination of market research, behavioural insights, and strategic proposal development.
* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that use data to unravel digital behavioural patterns. I would especially like to gain deeper insights into in-group out-group dynamics in online spaces.
* ⚡ Fun facts: I am currently reading 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism' by Shoshana Zuboff to qualify my interest in Computational Social Science. 
  My favourite data science projects tend to fall into either mechanistic or inferential categories.
